						   <p> The company has 3,782,000 employees around the world and 3500 employees in UK <br><br> 
							Hot Beans company has been made in UK but the reason that UK branches are small is, they are used for managing the company and only 500 employees in UK are web developers. 
						   </p>
						   <p>
                            month each boss will be reporting all the information to the main branch. And each month the branch with highest quality webs will get some extra money for making the office look better and more comfortable but the main branch does not make any website because in main branch we manage the company.
